        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Aloo Posto or simply potatoes (aloo) cooked in a lightly spiced poppy seeds (posto) paste is that dish, which almost every Bengali is fond of. There may be some exceptional cases, but those are very few. This Aloo Posto recipe is easy to prepare, flavorful, makes for a great side dish with a dal-bhaat (dal and rice) combination, and is also naturally vegan and gluten free. You should definitely give this classic dish of Bengal a try.</p>
